# Capstone

### Project: Understanding Mental Embeddings in Neurotypical and Neurodivergent Populations

This repo contains files and articles related to my capstone this spring. I worked on a project with the Multisensory Research Lab in VUMC and focused on implementing [Muse](https://muse-model.github.io) text-to-image model, [training neural networks](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/main/imagenet) on ImageNet, and began working on image captioning and text prompts.

Much of my work happened in ACCRE using slurm scripts which I can't really link here. I did upload an example slurm script in the training folder above, but I don't have a lot of notebooks or specific code to report on my repository. 

I also began working on image captioning and prompts, so I've linked some of the resources I have been looking at here as well.
